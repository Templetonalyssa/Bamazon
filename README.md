Liri Bot is a program that runs in node to give you information on music and movies. Liri has four programs you can run. 
This first function is "concert-this". See the screenshot below:

"concert-this" requires you to enter node, the file name (liri.js), the command "concert-this", and an artist whose shows you would like to see. Once run, it will show you upcoming concerts of that artist in your area.
